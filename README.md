# FaceOn

#### Use the power of facial recognition to log on faster, more securely, and with less hassle than fingerprint identification or phone number verification.

#### **Note**:
This app uses the getUserMedia API, which only Chrome and Firefox support at this time.
IE and Safari do not support it.  Opera may support it partially.
